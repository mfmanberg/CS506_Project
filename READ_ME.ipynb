    "NYISO was birthed out of a catastrophic power outage, costing the American public millions and resulting in deaths. They have their own forecasts (they release publicly and utilize similar methodology as the private utility companies). They oversee all of NY's jurisdictions, with an imperfect picture of (my guess due to poor data sharing common in utilities) of when new load is introduced or removed in addition to other noise. This forecast is important to prevent future catastrophe. "

    "Utility companies profit is already negotiated between the state and them in the rate case. They legally cannot charge more for what they buy, they can only charge utility bills for the Distribution and carry over the buying cost. A better forecast would result in less spot buying, and save the ratepayer (the person who pays the utility bill) millions of dollars a day in addition  to further informing NYISO’s important oversight.\n",

    "Previous forecasts are rooted in a deterministic methodology despite the system acting as a non-linear chaotic environment. An empirical, dynamic, and inductive data-driven approach such as Deep Learning may prove to outcompete current forecasts. Business events, from outages, industrial load spikes, residential load spikes, etc… cause a sudden seemingly-stochastic drop in load. A decision-tree may prevent further error from switching models (such as the criteria of 10% error given a time-period). \n"
